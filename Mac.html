            <h1>Machine Learning</h1>
            <p>
                Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows software applications to
                become more accurate at predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so
                <br>
                <br>
                Less than a decade after breaking the Nazi encryption machine Enigma and helping the Allied Forces win
                World War II, mathematician Alan Turing changed history a second time with a simple question: "Can
                machines think?"

                Turing's paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" (1950), and it's subsequent Turing Test,
                established the fundamental goal and vision of artificial intelligence.
                At it's core, AI is the branch of computer science that aims to answer Turing's question in the
                affirmative. It is the endeavor to replicate or simulate human intelligence in machines.

                The expansive goal of artificial intelligence has given rise to many questions and debates. So much so,
                that no singular definition of the field is universally accepted.

                The major limitation in defining AI as simply "building machines that are intelligent" is that it
                doesn't actually explain what artificial intelligence is? What makes a machine intelligent?

                In their groundbreaking textbook Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, authors Stuart Russell and
                Peter Norvig approach the question by unifying their work around the theme of intelligent agents in
                machines. With this in mind, AI is "the study of agents that receive percepts from the environment and
                perform actions." (Russel and Norvig viii)
